This has been pretty much a straight port from the chia clvm repo, with converting the existing code written in python as per my understanding of what it was doing. Perhaps we can maintain a table of what needs doing and who is picking it up.


| Code | Description | Who is working on it |
| -------- | ------- |
| More_Options | the bulk of the implementation needs completing. |  |
| All tests | tests | |
| | | |
